## What is the CAPM?

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a theory from the 1960s.  Its discoverer won the econ Nobel prize.
- The intuition is:
  - Market risk is the biggest risk that a diversified investor faces.
  - The risk of each asset should be measured in terms of how much it contributes to market risk.
  - The risk premium of each asset should depend (linearly) on this measure of risk.

##  CAPM Formula

. . .

The CAPM formula is 

. . .

$$\bar{r}_i - r_f = \beta_i(\bar{r}_m-r_f)$$

. . .

where $r_m$ = market return and $\beta_i$ is the slope of the regression line of $r_i-r_f$ on $r_m-r_f$.

## Cost of equity capital

- The CAPM is widely used to estimate expected returns to compute discount factors for corporate investment projects.
  - The return shareholders expect is $r_f + \beta_i(\bar{r}_m - r_f)$.
  - This is the required return on equity capital for corporate projects.
- The CAPM does not work well enough to use in an investments context.


## Foundation of the theory

- The hypothesis of the CAPM is that the market is a frontier portfolio, with borrowing rate = savings rate.
  - The rationale is that each investor chooses a frontier portfolio, which is the tangency portfolio with borrowing or saving.
  - So, the market is the tangency portfolio.
- In the usual application in the U.S., the "market portfolio" is the U.S. stock market.

## Deriving the CAPM

- The equation for a frontier portfolio is $kCw = \bar{r} - r_f1_n$.
- If we imagine that we know $C$ and $w$, then this is an equation for the risk premia $\bar{r}-r_f1_n$.
- Specifying $w$ = market, this equation is the CAPM.
- The equation says that the marginal benefit of an asset (its risk premium) is proportional to its marginal contribution to the risk of the *market portfolio*.
- This marginal contribution is measured by beta.

## Beta <a href="https://learn-investments.rice-business.org/capm/costequity"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.65in;" align=right></a>

- Beta is the slope in the regression:

. . . 

$$r-r_{f}=\alpha + \beta(r_m-r_f)+e$$

- where $r_{m}$ = market return and
$e$ = zero-mean risk.
- Beta answers this question:
  - if the market is up 1%, how much do we expect the asset to be up, all else equal?
  - e.g., $\beta$ = 2 $\Rightarrow$ we expect the asset to be up 2%.
 

## The CAPM and the data <a href="https://learn-investments.rice-business.org/capm/sml-industries"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.65in;" align="right" vertical-align="center"></a>

- The CAPM doesn't fit the data very well.
- A simple example is industry returns. Average returns are mostly unrelated to betas.
