## CPI and inflation

- Standard U.S. price index is the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers.
- Basket of goods with prices sampled monthly in 87 urban areas
- % change in the index is the inflation rate
- Inflation in 2021 was 7%, so a typical item that cost \$100 on Jan 1 cost \$107 on Dec 31.
- We say that the $107 on Dec 31 is $100 in Jan 1 dollars.
- Any price $x$ on Dec 31 is $x/1.07$ in Jan 1 dollars.


## Multiple years

- If there is 7% inflation in 2021 followed by 5% inflation in 2022, then 
  - the cost of a \$100 item grows to \$107 and then another 5\%, which is $100 \times 1.07 \times 1.05$.
- Any price $x$ at the end of 2022 would be 

. . .

$$\frac{x}{1.07 \times 1.05}$$

in beginning of 2021 dollars.

## Constant dollars

- For any dates 0, 1, ..., T and inflation rates $i_1, \ldots, i_T$, we say that a price $x$ at date $T$ is

. . .

$$\frac{x}{(1+i_1) \cdots (1+i_T)}$$
in date 0 dollars.

- We might refer to "date-0 dollars" as "constant dollars."
- The denominator in the above expression is $\text{CPI}_T/\text{CPI}_0$.

## Real rate of return

- Suppose you make 10% on your portfolio and there is 7% inflation. Consider an item that cost \$100 at the beginning of the year.
- Each \$100 of your portfolio at the beginning of the year would buy 1 of them.
  - The \$100 grows to \$110.
  - The cost of the item goes to \$107.
  - So you could buy 1 and 3/107 items.  
- Your [real rate of return]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"} is 3/107. 

## General formula 

. . .

The general formula for the real rate of return $r^*$ is 

. . .

$$r^* = \frac{r-i}{1+i}$$ 

## Compounding real rates of return <a href="https://learn-investments.rice-business.org/borrowing-saving/inflation"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.8in;" align="right"> </a>

- The formula $r^*=(r-i)/(1+i)$ implies

. . .

$$(1+r_1^*) \cdots (1+r_n^*) = \frac{(1+r_1)\cdots (1+r_T)}{(1+i_1) \cdots (1+i_T)}$$

- The denominator is $\text{CPI}_T / \text{CPI}_0$, so compounding real rates of return "takes inflation out" of compounded nominal rates.
- It is the accumulation from $1 in date--0 dollars.
